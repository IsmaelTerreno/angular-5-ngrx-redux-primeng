# Angular 5 + redux for state management.
Simple app Angular Demo that implements the Redux Store to manage state.

The application has implemented the management of Redux states together with Angular 5. Basically it consumes a REST API that brings a list of users, this list as well as all the actions can be seen with chrome "redux dev tools".
You can click on the row of the user table and see the detail. As well as a simple login only with the basics (without security).

The url to use are:
"http://localhost:4200/#/users-list"
"http://localhost:4200/#/home"


For more details you can go to the routes of the code.

Just to give an idea of the reason of this project, is to show the possibilities we can have when working with redux + Angular 5 so that we can take advantage of the power that both have together, personally I had a lot of fun making this sample of project and I think that many developers can take advantage of it.

To run the project, just execute "yarn install" and "yarn start"
