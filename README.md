# Angular 5 + ngrx reactive libraries + redux for state management + PrimeNg for awesome UI.

The application has implemented the management of Redux states together with Angular 5. Basically it consumes a REST API that brings a list of users, this list as well as all the actions can be seen with chrome "redux dev tools".
You can click on the row of the user table and see the detail. As well as a simple login only with the basics (without security).

The url to use are:
"http://localhost:4200/#/users-list"
"http://localhost:4200/#/home"


For more details you can go to the routes of the code.

Just to give an idea of the reason of this project, is to show the possibilities we can have when working with [@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) (Reactive libraries for Angular) + Angular 5 + PrimeNg so that we can take advantage of the power that both have together, personally I had a lot of fun doing this sample of project and I think that many developers can take advantage of it. I also want to mention a beautiful framework to make incredible UI in a short time with layers of responsive design easy to implement and with amazing results, it is [PrimeNG](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/), I recommend seeing this framework and if you are also passionate about ReactJs there is no problem because it is also [PrimeReact](https://www.primefaces.org/primeReact/), in conclusion do not miss it, I'm a developer as many so I guess you're probably going to like it a lot.

To run the project, just execute "yarn install" and "yarn start"
